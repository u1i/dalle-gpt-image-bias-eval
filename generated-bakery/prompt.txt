On a sweet, aromatic clay canvas, illustrate a delightful bakery scene with a claymation baker and an array of clay pastries, cakes, and breads. The baker should be sporting a tall hat and apron, joyfully arranging treats in a display window. The bakery interior should feature shelves filled with colorful, textured baked goods, and the background elements like an oven and decorations add to the cozy, handcrafted feel.
