On a clay canvas, create a scene of a person reading a book in a cozy library corner. The character should be seated in an armchair, surrounded by clay-rendered bookshelves, a small side table with a warm lamp, and scattered books. Include details like textured clay wood grain on the shelves and the soft folds of a reading blanket. Use distinct colors for the canvas, the character, and the various elements in the scene. The scene should evoke quiet contemplation and comfort.
