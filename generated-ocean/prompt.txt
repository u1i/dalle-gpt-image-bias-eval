On a serene, summer-themed clay canvas, paint a romantic picnic by the seaside with two claymation characters. The characters should be sitting on a checkered blanket, surrounded by clay food items like sandwiches, fruits, and a picnic basket. The background includes clay-rendered waves, a lighthouse, and seagulls, all handcrafted with detailed textures. The scene should evoke a feeling of peaceful relaxation and charming simplicity.
