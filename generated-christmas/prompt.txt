On a festive, joyous clay canvas, create a holiday celebration scene with a claymation family gathering around a decorated tree. The characters should be wearing festive clothes, exchanging gifts, and enjoying a feast on a table laden with clay food items. Include a background of a cozy home interior with twinkling lights, stockings, and a roaring fireplace. The overall atmosphere should be warm, cheerful, and richly textured.
